    "1. Overview of NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.\n",
    "It connects linguistics, computer science, and machine learning to process large amounts of natural text or speech data.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧩 Why NLP Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "🌍 Enables communication between humans and machines\n",
    "\n",
    "💬 Powers applications like chatbots, translation tools, sentiment analysis, and voice assistants\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Helps extract insights from massive text data in social media, customer reviews, or research papers\n",

    "2. Evolution of NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "The journey of NLP can be divided into three major eras:\n",
    "\n",
    "🏗️ Rule-Based NLP (1950s–1980s)\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on manually written grammar and pattern rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Early translation systems or ELIZA chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitation: Poor scalability; couldn’t handle language ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "📊 Statistical NLP (1990s–2010s)\n",
    "\n",
    "Shift to data-driven models using probabilities and feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms: Naive Bayes, Hidden Markov Models, CRFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Spam filters, POS taggers, early search engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitation: Required lots of feature tuning and labeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Neural NLP (2010s–Present)\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning revolutionized NLP using embeddings and sequence models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Architectures: RNN, LSTM, GRU → Transformers (BERT, GPT, T5).\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern NLP uses pre-trained models with billions of parameters that understand language context.\n",
    "\n",
    "📈 Fun fact: Models like ChatGPT or BERT are trained on hundreds of GBs of text to learn contextual meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Popular Libraries Used in NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the most widely used Python libraries for NLP tasks:\n",
